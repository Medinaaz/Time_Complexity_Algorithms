In order to run this homework you should enter three parameters

1. 
./program	 = name of the program after you link it with gcc command and create an object file with it $g++ program.cpp -o program
2.
 "b" or "m" 	 = second argument takes only one character which is b for bubble sort and m for merge sort (the quotations are not allowed)

3. numbers to be sorted = the numbers that you can sort are : 1000,10000,100000,1000000
4. 
filename = it can be either sorted.txt or unsorted.txt
